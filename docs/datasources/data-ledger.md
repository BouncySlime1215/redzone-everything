# Data ledger

Planners fill in one block per cycle. Sources and verdicts: [sources-catalog.md](sources-catalog.md).
Waves and targets: [ingest-plan.md](ingest-plan.md).

Rules: count realistic values (rows x populated fields), de-duplicated against what is already
held. Synthetic is always its own row. Never list a red source. Never write keys or tokens here.

## Cycle template

Copy this block, set the cycle number and date, and fill every column.

### Cycle NN (YYYY-MM-DD)

| Source | Wave | Verdict | Status (planned / pulling / done / blocked) | Seasons held | Rows | Fields | Values added this cycle | Values held (cumulative) | Stored GB | Kaggle shard / version | HF backup (yes / no, not allowed) | Attribution in README + model card (yes / no) | Nick action needed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| example: Retrosheet events | 1 | green | done | 1950-2025 | 15.0M | 100 | 1.50B | 1.50B | 2.0 | rz-data/v3 shard retro-01 | yes | yes | none | notice text added |

### Cycle totals

| Bucket | Values added | Values held | Stored GB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Green, observed | | | |
| Yellow, observed | | | |
| Derived (green + yellow) | | | |
| ESPN-gated (only if Nick approved) | | | |
| Synthetic (cache) | | | |
| **Total** | | | |
| Quota used / 215 GB (working cap 120 GB) | | | |

### Saturation check

| Check | This cycle | Last cycle | Stop? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Distinct real events held | | | |
| Distinct real slate-nights held | | | |
| Synthetic : real token ratio (stop near 3x) | | | |
| Held-out real-night world-model loss after the last 2x synthetic step (stop if < 1% better twice) | | | |
| Distinct synthetic slates (stop near 1-2M) | | | |
